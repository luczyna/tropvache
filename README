Tags: html5, boilerplate

This is my wordpress template, named after my site. It is based on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/). It may not be the most wordpress child-themeable theme, but if someone isn't afraid of editing templates instead of changing logos through the wordpress dashboard, please have fun with this as you would like.

I made this design with my own quirks and style. I rely on Advanced Custom Fields to collect certain data for my data, but have attempted a very minimal approach on field collection.

There is a cow for my logo (think: vache). It dances. And I think that's cool.
